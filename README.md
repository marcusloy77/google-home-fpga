# google-home-fpga
Basic google home like program for an fpga board - 
utilized vivado, 
all of my coded files are in the src folder, 

including features such as:
a 'garage door sensor', 
a 'sensor light', 
a 'temprature controller' 
and a 'bathroom light' 

- the idea here is all of these are either set off by buttons/sensors, or a timer that I built in, and react by lighting up leds, where wires connecting these devices would replace the leds in a real scenario
